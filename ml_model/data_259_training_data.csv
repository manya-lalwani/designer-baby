"Looking at data collections VII–X, more than 66% of the couples desired a male (162/246). This may say something about social sexing and the potential for skewing sex ratios one way or the other.",Social Need
"Social sexing remains illegal in most countries (i.e. Australia, China, Europe), however, preferential selection of one sex over another most likely occurs and is not reported.",Social Need
"Most, if not all, chromosome screening panels used for PGS contain probes for the sex chromosomes and, therefore, many couples may be aware of the sex of the embryos ahead of transfer and may select or lean towards one gender or the other when choosing embryos for transfer.",Social Need
 It is important to monitor the use and safety of PGD as it involves manipulation of the embryo and genetic testing of human embryos,Medical Need
Preimplantation diagnosis of inherited disease allows the selective transfer of unaffected embryos and avoids the possibility of a termination after conventional prenatal diagnosis later in pregnancy.2,Medical Need

"the more lasting significance of our new genetic powers may not be the freedom to reproduce in new ways, but the obligation to reproduce only in the most advanced, most effective, and safest ways possible",Social Need
"Those who oppose discarding unfit embryos or aborting unfit fetuses will soon become — perhaps already are — a dissident culture, tolerated at best, but more likely heavily regulated by a society that increasingly expects only healthy children to be born.",Social Need
An individual couple may wish to have a baby who has no risk of inheriting Tay-Sachs disease or transmitting sickle cell disease. Or they may want a child with a particular hair color or of a particular sex … No moral principle seems to provide sufficient reason to condemn individual eugenic goals.,Social Need
"One group of computer scientists in Berkeley, known as the rationalists, fear that AI poses an existential risk to humanity—so they are trying to use genomics to breed smarter humans who can save us all.",Social Need

"Tech futurists such as Elon Musk are urging the intellectually gifted to multiply, while professional matchmakers are setting up tech execs with brilliant partners partly to get brilliant offspring.",Social Need
"I think they have a perception that they are smart and they are accomplished, and they deserve to be where they are because they have ‘good genes,’ Now they have a tool where they think that they can do the same thing in their kids as well, right?”",Social Need
"There is a whole ecosystem now of usually super high net-worth people, or rationalist people who are obsessed with intelligence like in Berkeley, who really want to know the IQ scores so they can use that as one of the criteria for selecting their embryo,",Social Need

If grit and ambition and curiosity—if we had polygenic scores for those things we’d be much more interested.”,Social Need
The couple worried about diseases in their families such as Alzheimer’s and cancer. They also cared about IQ forecasts because they hoped their kids might be able to solve the world’s important problems and enjoy the life of the mind.,Social Need

"This element of parental choice, he said, is a critical difference between the rationalist push for smarter babies and the dark history of government eugenics programs, such as Nazi Germany’s elimination of “undesirable” people.",Social Need
"But the science to understand your future child — their potential health risks, traits, even IQ — already exists. And yet, the conversation hasn’t caught up. The science sprinted ahead while public awareness stood still.",Social Need
"Every family deserves to know that these tools exist, they’re safe, and they can help you make more thoughtful decisions about your future child.",Social Need
"Modern family planning is here. For some, that means IVF+. For others, it’s getting their baby’s Preview. ",Social Need
Most DNA variants work together to shape your characteristics. It’s usually not a single variant that causes a feature.,Social Need
"Familiar diseases and traits like cancers, heart disease, height, or extraversion are products of many of these common variants, or a mix of high-effect and common variants collectively influencing your risks and traits.",Social Need
"People who get their whole genomes sequenced at Nucleus will receive an extensive assessment of their health and trait dispositions, along with appropriate personalized next steps.",Social Need
Nucleus has taken steps to statistically account for this data imbalance. Your scores are always relative to people who are of a similar ancestral background to you. ,Social Need
"common genetic score measures the combined effect your common variants have on your diseases and trait dispositions, relative to people who are of similar ancestry to you",Social Need
"The higher the score, the more your common variants place you at a higher genetic risk of developing the disease in question. In the context of traits, this means you’re more likely to have that trait or a greater expression of that trait",Social Need
The first reason to honor parents’ desire to use polygenic scores to choose which embryo to implant is that parents have reasons to want to minimize disease and select traits they believe will promote their children’s welfare.,Social Need
Parents already spend a fortune on education and health care after their children are born to promote their health and well-being. Some parents also wish to influence the traits of their children before they are born.,Social Need
"When we make procreative choices or pass policies about the choices people are permitted to make, we are influencing not merely how well-off future people will be: we are determining who will exist at all.",Social Need
Julian Savulescu (2001) argues that we ought to select an embryo that would result in a child with the best chance of the best life.,Social Need
Healthier people also tend to have positive externalities for other people with whom they share the planet.,Social Need
"People with a healthier immune system are less likely to transmit infectious diseases, and those with fewer illnesses will impose fewer social costs on families and communities",Social Need
"Brighter people tend not only to earn more income and education, which is good for them",Social Need
"But they also tend to contribute more to scientific innovation (Shulman and Bostrom, 2014) and to public goods, which affects the quality of the institutions that we share",Social Need
"But the reason they exhibit more cooperative behavior in competitive situations like prisoner’s dilemma and public goods games – situations where there are immediate personal gains from defection, but larger gains in the future from cooperation – seems to derive from the fact that intelligence is positively correlated with patience and self-control",Social Need
These considerations give us moral reasons to allow parents to select against disease and in favor of intelligence,Social Need
Autonomy is the bedrock of modern medical ethics. Governments and physicians respect parental autonomy by permitting them to make choices about themselves and their children,Social Need
respect for reproductive autonomy is perhaps the most prominent argument in favour of using PRSs for embryo screening,Social Need
Another reason for deferring to parental choice is that parents tend to be in a better position than states or insurance companies to express their values through their reproductive choices,Social Need
"For example, some parents may value having children who live long and healthy lives, while others prioritize intellectual or physical prowess, even if that means an embryo they choose is predicted to have a shorter life, or a greater likelihood of old-age afflictions like Alzheimer disease.",Social Need
Some even say they would use IVF electively (when it’s not medically necessary) so that they can minimize the risk of disease or influence other traits that they value in their children.,Social Need
around half of young Americans think it’s ethically defensible to select embryos for cognitive ability,Social Need
"Eighty years later, the taboo has become so firmly entrenched in Western culture that even mentioning genetic reasons for the relative success of a person or group over another can get journalists fired, professors reprimanded, and scholars defenestrated.",Social Need
"preferences can change quickly, that preferences tend to have more authority when they are informed rather than uninformed, and that preferences are more likely to be informed when a new technology (such as polygenic risk scores) becomes powerful enough to attract the attention of potential parents.",Social Need
"we reviewed evidence that there is already some support for the right to select embryos, even for traits like cognitive ability. We think that this support will only grow as people learn more about heritability and genetic testing.",Social Need
"Giving your children opportunities can be good for them, even if it is driven in part by a competitive desire for social status",Social Need
"Indeed, one of the good things that might result from people knowing more about heritability is that they’ll relax a bit more as parents, given that so much of their children’s capacities is shaped by factors outside their control",Social Need
"Still, as mentioned above, there are enormous benefits to future people from having (on average) better physical and mental health as a result of being selected by parents via polygenic scores.",Social Need
"Though it may be a reason not to subsidize all the potential technology parents may wish to use in order to “perfect” their children, especially those that might create endless arms races with negative social value",Social Need
This can be used to help visualize and quantify how many quality-adjusted or disability-adjusted life years one embryo is likely to have relative to another,Social Need
"Parents can then focus their attention on one index, while also taking a peek at other predictors they might express an interest in, such as intelligence or neuroticism, and particular disease traits they’re especially worried about.",Social Need
an embryo selected on the basis of a polygenic score for one trait may also have an unusually high (or low) polygenic score for other traits that parents do not intend to target... The vast majority of relationships between genetic variants and traits are not yet known—and we will never know all of them,Social Need
"To the contrary, selecting against a disease trait is likely to have downstream beneficial effects due to synergistic (positive) pleiotropy.",Social Need
"But the rarity and clear biological grounding of antagonistic pleiotropy suggest that polygenic embryo screening, accompanied by appropriate genetic counseling, can have clear benefits to future children without introducing substantial risks of unintended harm",Social Need
"Giving exceptional people the freedom to pursue a path that results in unequal income, status, or other social goods also respects the freedom to develop talents that make people unique and interesting",Social Need
"Except in rare cases, embryo screening is not going to give otherwise ordinary parents the ability to create geniuses and giants based on current technologies.",Social Need
"And even when it does impose costs, we must always measure the social costs of any policy or social norm against the benefit of allowing parents to use polygenic scores to reduce disease risks for their own children.",Social Need
t erects taboos around important topics like behavioral genetics and the ethics of embryo screening. Taboos preclude clear thinking about how to use genetic information to achieve socially just outcomes,Social Need

"“humanity plus” – people who are still recognizably human, but much smarter, stronger and healthier.",Social Need
"To those who support human enhancement, many of whom call themselves transhumanists, technological breakthroughs like these are springboards not only to healing people but to changing and improving humanity.",Social Need
"Up to this point, they say, humans have largely worked to control and shape their exterior environments because they were powerless to do more. ",Social Need
transhumanists predict that a convergence of new technologies will soon allow people to control and fundamentally change their bodies and minds,Social Need
"Instead of leaving a person’s physical well-being to the vagaries of nature, supporters of these technologies contend, science will allow us to take control of our species’ development, making ourselves and future generations stronger, smarter, healthier and happier.",Social Need
"Finding the blueprint for life, and successfully decoding and reading it, has given researchers an opportunity to alter human physiology at its most fundamental level.",Social Need
" Manipulating this genetic code – a process known as genetic engineering – could allow scientists to produce people with stronger muscles, harder bones and faster brains. ",Social Need
"When combined with researchers’ growing understanding of the genetic links to various diseases, CRISPR could conceivably help eliminate a host of maladies in people before they are born.",Medical Need
"This may be the area where serious enhancement first becomes possible, because it’s easier to do many things at the embryonic stage than in adults using traditional drugs or machine implants",Social Need
"For many transhumanists, expanding our capacities begins with the organ that most sets humans apart from other animals: the brain.",Social Need
"many transhumanists and others predict that while new drugs (say, a specifically designed, IQ-boosting “smart pill”) or genetic engineering could result in substantially enhanced brain function",Social Need
"Given the brain’s importance, cognitive enhancement might be the holy grail of transhumanism. But many futurists say enhancement technologies will likely be used to transform the whole body, not just one part of it.",Social Need
"But as with CRISPR and gene editing, artificial blood could ultimately be used as part of a broader effort at human enhancement. It could be engineered to clot much faster than natural human blood, for instance, preventing people from bleeding to death",Social Need
"Indeed, like virtually any computer, these cells could receive “software updates” that would allow them to fight a variety of threats, such as a new infection or a specific kind of cancer.",Social Need
eventually we’ll transition to realms of bliss that we can’t conceive of at this time because we’re incapable of conceiving it. Enhancing our brains will be about making us capable.,Social Need
"new technologies would offer people amazing opportunities for self-improvement and growth, including the ability to direct our evolution as a species.",Social Need
"No longer, he said, would a person’s physical and psychological attributes be subject to the capricious whims of nature.",Social Need
Supporters of human enhancement say the goal is not to create a race of superhumans but to use technological tools to improve humanity and the human condition,Social Need
"For me, enhancement is a very practical way to give us new options to make our lives better",Social Need
"By giving people increased memory and problem-solving skills, cognitive enhancement will help us be more creative by giving us the ability to put more things together in new ways",Social Need
The enhancement project could allow people who have natural inequalities to be brought up to everyone else’s level,Social Need
"Intelligence was regarded as one of the good qualities superior men possessed, in turn beneficial for society as a whole.",Social Need
"there is also a strong desire on the part of potential parents to have children who will, themselves, have good lives: something that might be hindered, in the opinion of prospective parents, by the presence of certain conditions.",Social Need
"What it means to be healthy, however, is evolving, and is doing so in an upward manner: in the direction of “healthy” standing in for “no discernible physical or mental impairments, and no predicted such impairments” “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being”",Social Need
"It is, therefore, not enough for parents to have a physically healthy child: they also want their child to have the best possible chance at social success, which could explain why they are concerned with the SAT scores of sperm and ova donors. ",Social Need
The moral case against voluntary choices to advance eugenic goals by individuals or couples has not been persuasively made,Social Need
"Given the power and authority granted to parents to seek to improve or better their children by environmental interventions, at least some forms of genetic selection or alteration seem equally ethically defensible if they are undertaken freely and do not disempower or disadvantage children",Social Need

"it could even be argued that parents should be free to pick the eyebrow shape or freckle pattern of their children or other equally innocuous traits as long as their selection imposed no risk for the child, did not compromise the child's chance of maximising his or her opportunities, or lead to parents becoming overly invested in superficial aspects of the child's appearance or behaviour",Social Need
"allowing parents to teach their children religious values, hobbies, and customs as they see fit, it would be difficult to reject it as overly subjective when matters turn to the selection of a genetic endowment for their child.",Social Need
There is nothing terrible about subjectivity in a decision to indulge preferences about the traits of one's child as long as those preferences do nothing to hurt or impair the child.,Social Need
 It is hard to argue in a world that currently tolerates so much inequity in the circumstances under which children are brought into being that there is something more offensive or more morally problematic about biological advantages as opposed to social and economic advantages.,Social Need
No moral principle seems to provide sufficient reason to condemn individual eugenic goals,Social Need
it is not clear that it is any less ethical to allow parents to pick the eye colour of their child or to try and create a fetus with a propensity for mathematics,Social Need
Or they may want a child with a particular hair colour or sex. If their choice is free and informed then there is no reason to think that such a choice is immoral on grounds of force or coercion.,Social Need

"t may be an unavoidable moment in the evolution of humanity. To supplant ourselves, to change and become better, is inherent in human nature. ",Social Need
our limits have constantly been enhanced and exceeded throughout human history. The aim of improving and going beyond our present condition is what explains the various revolutions ,Social Need
"We were created to always go further, surpass barriers, and enhance ourselves. We cannot avoid enhancing ourselves for the simple reason that it is our human nature that urges us to be better every time.",Social Need
"Genetic mistakes are part of human nature (otherwise we would have to restrict our notion of human being to the genetically perfect beings, a description that hardly suits any member of humankind), but the urge to correct such mistakes is also part of human nature. ",Social Need
"Therefore, gene editing might introduce some modifications in the genetic code we were born with, but it does not change human nature; instead it reaffirms our nature.",Social Need
"However, enhancement (becoming stronger and healthier) is natural to humanity; it is the defining note of the human species. Looking back in time, the story of humankind has been one of enhancement.",Social Need
We are always trying to supplant ourselves (Buchanan 2011). We cannot assume that human nature is something defined and fixed (Fenton 2006),Social Need
"On the contrary, we cannot avoid changing ourselves for the simple reason that we are human. Gene editing is just another way of being human.",Social Need
"Moreover, since such autonomy is the foundation of dignity, there is no immorality, but rather, intervention in our gene pool is a moral requirement for the benefit of individuals who will be affected by the change",Social Need
"If we decry genetic engineering because of its potential to lead us down a slippery slope to potential force or compulsion, the imposition of arbitrary standards, or inequities that might result, we must also decry medical care in general",Social Need

GGE provides new perspectives for infertility patients who have no other option to create offspring that are genetically related to them,Medical Need
The method could be used to correct the mutation in the TUBB8-gene which is known to cause developmental arrest after fertilization,Medical Need
"As we have seen, GGE could be used in order to prevent hereditary monogenic disease like Huntington’s or ?-thalassemia",Medical Need
"As in the case of the carrier of the MYBPC3 mutation mentioned above, GGE would allow individuals with certain hereditary diseases to reproduce without passing on the disease. ",Medical Need
This would mean an immense benefit for individuals with a known genetic risk who want to have children. They could fulfil their wish to have children without the risk of severe health conditions or ailments.,Medical Need
GGE could be used to prevent offspring from inheriting pathogenic genes.,Medical Need
"For female patients with a ’missense mutation’ in the TUBB8 in oocytes, GGE could also be an option",Medical Need
"we are morally obliged to improve health outcomes for future generations. In addition, the implementation of a large-scale program would lead to an eventual decrease in healthcare costs.",Social Need
"Taken in its totality, supporters of GGE claim that in the light of its public health benefits, this pursuit should be regarded as a moral imperative",Social Need
"The argument implies that by using GGE, a future individual can be prevented from having a monogenic disease. ",Medical Need
" In these cases, the pathogenic genes are eliminated or modified, so that they will not be transferred to the future individual. Thus, the future individual is prevented from inheriting the genetic defect.",Medical Need
"By stretching the boundaries of the term, this therapeutic procedure may also have the effect of disease prevention",Medical Need
"If we consider GGE as a possible means of disease prevention (notwithstanding the terminological difficulties outlined above), there are certain cases that fulfill these conditions, i.e. monogenic diseases like Huntington’s.",Medical Need

GGE is a promising method that allows couples with a known genetic risk to create healthy offspring that is genetically related to both partners.,Medical Need

Using germline gene editing to prevent single gene disorders will thus provide a more effective way to reduce the incidence of these diseases in future generations than preimplantation genetic diagnosis,Medical Need
"As we understand more about genetics, and more about the aetiology of these disorders, it will be possible to reduce our susceptibility to these diseases.",Medical Need

"Through GGE we can treat some genetic conditions that are beyond the current ability of traditional medicines, such as Alzheimer’s disease, muscular dystrophy, and cystic fibrosis",Medical Need
"It may take decades to develop traditional medicines to manage these conditions, while genome editing offers a more immediate solution, as we may soon have the technology to identify and remove the gene mutations that cause diseases.",Medical Need
"GGE could entirely and permanently eradicate some serious conditions that cause suffering for millions of people, and will otherwise cause suffering for millions more in the future",Medical Need

" Then GGE could, in principle, allow the genetic modification of an otherwise healthy embryo to produce a matching child. However, a more likely scenario enables the use of donor stem cells that have been modified to serve the same purpose.",Medical Need
"In a similar way, GGE might seem an attractive option for some intended parents because it could avoid the destruction of embryos after PGD and offer a direct fix for affected embryos.",Medical Need
