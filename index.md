## How IVF began a new wave of discourse and perspectives on reproductive healthcare

Since the birth of the first “test-tube baby” in 1978, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has transformed the landscape of reproductive medicine. For the first time, people who could not conceive naturally were no longer constrained by their biological limitations. IVF introduced a new paradigm in which reproduction could occur outside the body, forcing society, medicine, and ethics to reconsider what “natural” reproduction meant. The technology also reshaped how individuals plan families, allowing them not only to overcome infertility but to anticipate future health challenges and make proactive reproductive choices. IVF marked the start of a new era in which reproductive freedom expanded beyond biology and into biotechnology.

## Preimplantation Genetic Testing

The widespread adoption of IVF created the foundation for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), which allows embryos to be screened before implantation. With PGT, individuals and couples gained unprecedented control, not only over when to conceive, but also over the genetic characteristics of future children. After the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, PGT became far more powerful and precise, enabling clinicians to test embryos for thousands of genetic conditions. As the technology matured, clear classifications emerged:
- **PGT-M** for monogenic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs),
- **PGT-A** for aneuploidy screening, and
- **PGT-P** for polygenic traits such as predicted disease risk or complex traits.

Notably, **PGT-P is only legal in the United States**, making the country a major destination for reproductive tourism and raising global ethical questions about trait selection.

## Benefits of Reproductive Health Advancements: Tay-Sachs as a Case Study

Tay-Sachs disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, most common in Ashkenazi Jewish, French-Canadian, and Cajun populations. Before the advent of IVF and genetic screening, Tay-Sachs carried devastating consequences and occurred at significantly higher rates in these communities. The introduction of carrier screening in the 1970s, followed by IVF combined with PGT-M, dramatically reduced the number of children born with the disease. Today, Tay-Sachs is one of the most powerful examples of how reproductive technologies can prevent severe genetic disorders and reduce suffering. It demonstrates the potential for genetic tools to serve clear medical goals when applied responsibly.

## The Flip Side of Freedom of Choice

However, the same technologies that helped curb Tay-Sachs also revived difficult questions about eugenics. Historically, Tay-Sachs was misused as evidence in discriminatory ideologies targeting Jewish populations. With IVF and PGT, individuals and clinicians now face decisions that blur the line between disease prevention and trait selection. While eliminating severe genetic disorders can reduce harm, using similar tools to select traits risks reinforcing biased definitions of what counts as “normal,” “healthy,” or “desirable.” The challenge lies in determining where medical benefit ends and social preference begins.

## Preimplantation Gene Editing and the Future

Gene editing pushes reproductive technology even further by enabling direct modification of an embryo’s DNA. Tools like CRISPR-Cas9 make it technically possible to correct pathogenic mutations, enhance certain traits, or even introduce new genetic changes. The most well-known example is the controversial case of the CRISPR-edited babies born in China in 2018, which sparked international backlash and calls for strict regulation. Today, gene-editing embryos remains illegal in most countries, but research continues in areas such as preventing monogenic diseases or improving embryo viability. Policymakers, ethicists, and scientists are actively debating what kinds of edits should be allowed, who should access them, and how to prevent misuse as the technology rapidly advances.

## Our Project

USA is one of the only countries in the world offering Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis for Polygenic traits (PGD-P) and is on the path for rolling out preimplantation gene editing. Such services make the country a hotspot for reproductive tourism. As we head straight into a new era of reproductive technology, it is imperative to consider the long-term implications of such tools. Historically, the ability to modify genes along with the field of statistical genetics has been shrouded in eugenicist ideology. Such ideologies are often challenging to decouple from the medical benefits the technology could bring to a population. In this project, we aim to decouple the two using a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we will build a machine-learning model that can identify for consumers whether marketing material for these gene-editing and PGD-P services is treating diseases and disabilities as a medical need, a social construct, or a social need (eugenics territory). Secondly, we want to empower potential beneficiaries of the tools with an understanding of the future population genetics implications using a statistical and mathematical based simulation of how trait selection can penetrate and impact population genetics. We hope that the presentation of the two approaches through an accessible platform will allow the public to make informed and well-rounded decisions about their reproductive journeys.
